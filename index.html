            <p>I had a great childhood with brilliant parents.</p>

            <p>I did well at school - I was never bullied - and always had a decent handful of friends - some of whom, I still

            <p>I carried on doing well - academically and socially - at college and university, and in 2005 I started my career
              as a professional geek.</p>
            <p>Being a techie from Bristol, I didn’t have to look far for decent career opportunities.</p>
            <p>I’ve had four jobs in my career, and I’ve always moved to the next job as a positive, conscious choice.</p>
            <p>Driven by a motivation to learn new skills and (more recently) to do some good in the world.</p>
            <p>I like to think I have a good work ethic, I always want to go a great job, and I always want to make professional
              progress.

            <p>WHAT A TOP BLOKE!</p>
            <p>So - on 28th May 2018 - why was this top bloke struggling to hold back tears while helping choose some plants
              in a garden centre?</p>
            <p>CLUE: It was nothing to do with the flowers on offer.</p>

        <h2>I had burnt out</h2>
        <img src="images/burnt.jpg" />
        <aside class="notes">
          <p>I remember a conversation with a friend from 5 or 6 years ago when I said I didn’t understand why some people get
            so stressed about stuff.</p>
          <p>Just don’t worry about it!</p>
          <p>Although my tongue was in my cheek at the time, I still think I truly believed that stress was something that affected
            other people, but not me.</p>
          <p>I now realise not only that I am susceptible to stress, but it seems that those positive qualities of hard work,
            determination and drive have played a huge part in adding to the stress in my life.</p>
          <p>The unpleasant experience of holding back tears in a garden centre was the trigger that made me realise I needed
            to do something about my stress.</p>
          <p>There wasn’t one single event that lead to the garden centre experience.</p>
          <p>I had been aware of feeling stressed for at least six months and when I reflect on those months, I realise that
            it was inevitable that I would reach some sort of breaking point.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, these thoughts, feelings and behaviours are extremely common in our line of work</p>
          <p>I expect they are equally as common in plenty of other lines of work too</p>
          <p>Especially if you’re someone who feels passionate and determined to do a great job.</p>
          <p>Since these experiences are so common, there is a danger that we start to believe they’re an acceptable part of
            life, or even that they are desirable.</p>
          <p>Some amount of pressure can be useful for motivation but it’s so easy for things to spiral out of control until
            you reach breaking point.</p>
          <p>Nobody can argue that is a healthy place to be.</p>

            <p>This was a difficult thing to do. Hearing the words come out of my mouth made me upset. I found it hard to look
              at her while I was speaking. I didn’t know why it was so hard, but it was.</p>

            <p>The second person I spoke to about it was my boss. The conversation was equally as tough.</p>

            <p>I have a great relationship with Emma, and a great (but very different) relationship with my boss (both of them).
              This topic wasn’t difficult for me because I was worried what the other person would think - it was difficult
              for me because I wasn’t used to talking about what can be an awkward or even taboo issue: MENTAL HEALTH.</p>
