        <h2>I had burnt out</h2>
        <img src="images/burnt.jpg" />
        <aside class="notes">
          <p>I remember a conversation with a friend from 5 or 6 years ago when I said I didn’t understand why some
            people get
            so stressed about stuff.</p>
          <p>Just don’t worry about it!</p>
          <p>Although my tongue was in my cheek at the time, I still think I truly believed that stress was something
            that affected
            other people, but not me.</p>
          <p>I now realise not only that I am susceptible to stress, but it seems that those positive qualities of hard
            work,
            determination and drive have played a huge part in adding to the stress in my life.</p>
          <p>The unpleasant experience of holding back tears in a garden centre was the trigger that made me realise I
            needed
            to do something about my stress.</p>
          <p>There wasn’t one single event that lead to the garden centre experience.</p>
          <p>I had been aware of feeling stressed for at least six months and when I reflect on those months, I realise
            that
            it was inevitable that I would reach some sort of breaking point.</p>

          <p>Especially if you’re someone who feels passionate and determined to do a great job.</p>
          <p>Since these experiences are so common, there is a danger that we start to believe they’re an acceptable

            life, or even that they are desirable.</p>
          <p>Some amount of pressure can be useful for motivation but it’s so easy for things to spiral out of control

            <p>The Maslach Burnout Inventory was a piece of research that was published in 1981. It's a multiple choice
              questionnaire
              that aims to score a person in these three areas.</p>
            <p>MBI was created to assess service workers (e.g. Doctors and Nurses)</p>
            <p>Detachment, for me, was the one aspect I couldn't quite relate to expect perhaps for my loss of interest
              in socialising.</p>
            <p>For service workers like doctors and nurses, detachment can mean a dehumanized perception of clients -
              they are
              somehow deserving of their troubles.</p>

            <p>You remember I mentioned earlier that I’d once managed to trick someone into being my wife?</p>

            <p>Her name is Emma, and we’re still together and going strong - so naturally, the first conversation I had
              about
              my stress level was with her.</p>

            <p>This was a difficult thing to do. Hearing the words come out of my mouth made me upset. I found it hard
              to look
              at her while I was speaking. I didn’t know why it was so hard, but it was.</p>

            <p>The second person I spoke to about it was my boss. The conversation was equally as tough.</p>

            <p>I have a great relationship with Emma, and a great (but very different) relationship with my boss (both
              of them).
              This topic wasn’t difficult for me because I was worried what the other person would think - it was
              difficult
              for me because I wasn’t used to talking about what can be an awkward or even taboo issue: MENTAL HEALTH.</p>

            <p>Mental health can be seen as a big, scary phrase. It can conjure thoughts of old-skool asylums like “One
              Flew
              Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” or Arkum, with straight jackets, padded cells and prison-like environment.</p>
            <p>But everybody does have mental health - our minds are just as susceptible to becoming ill as our bodies.</p>
            <p>We don't need to wait to be put in a straight jacket before we try to make a positive change.</p>

            <p>Talking to family, friends and colleagues is a huge help but speaking to a professional is just as
              important
              because they will be trained to lead the conversation in certain directions to help assess your situation
              and
              advise suitable treatments.</p>
            <p>We all know the NHS is stretched and mental health may not get the attention and funding that it
              deserves, but
              there is help available so why not ask for professional help?</p>
            <p>The GP recommended making an appointment with BANES Talking Therapies.</p>

            <p>Time off is an interesting topic when it comes to work related stress and burnout. Two weeks off might
              help by
              removing yourself from the stressful situation and giving your mind a rest, but there’s a danger that
              going
              back to work could be even harder if nothing else has changed.</p>
            <p>Go back socially (maybe for a lunch) before going back to work? This way you can have any “how are you?”

              read a
              lot, I went to see an osteopath for my stiff neck, I got a full body massage, and I went to visit my Mum.

          <p class="fragment fade-up m-top">So I started a mental-health slack channel</p>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>A phrase that came up repeatedly in the Monzo talks was “giving permission”. In this context it means
              that all
              it takes is one person to start a public conversation ("make themselves vulnerable"), and this “gives
              permission” for others to do the same.</p>
            <p>So as a male developer in an office full of other male developers, the next move was obvious - I started
              a mental-health
              channel on Slack!</p>
            <p>Although I was a bit nervous about it, I was also quietly confident that there would be a positive
              response.
              I’d already had a couple of brief conversations about other people’s anxiety and depression so I knew
              there
              would be people who might like to use a mental-health channel.</p>
            <p>The response was really positive and the channel has been used to share recommendations for podcasts,
              articles
              and books. There was also a kind of #metoo effect where people have shared the fact that they’ve
              experienced
              problems in the past and come through them.</p>

            <p>I find it helps to keep yourself aware of how you're actually feeling.</p>
            <p>Looking back over the entries for the past few weeks can be a really interesting exercise, especially

          <h3>Look after yourself</h3>

            <p>Comparing yourself to others is one of the most unhelpful things you can do in life.</p>

            <p>I know my mental health issues haven’t got to an extremely serious point when compared to other people -
              I’ve
              never had a panic attack, I can leave the house on my own, I’ve never contemplated suicide - but that
              does
              not mean that my own problems aren’t worthy of my attention.</p>
            <p>I remember Scroobius Pip making this point in one of his podcasts and it really stuck with me.</p>
            <p>It might be true that there is always someone worse off than yourself, but if you broke your toe you
              probably
              wouldn’t avoid getting it treated just because there are people in the world who have broken their back!</p>
            <p>We shouldn’t consider issues with the mind to be any less worthy of treatment than issues with the body.</p>
            <p>Your problems are worthy of your attention!</p>

          <h3>Have conversations - Reduce stigma</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>Words - spoken or written - are what connect us to the world, and so speaking about it to people, and
              writing
              about this stuff, helps connect us to each other, and our true selves.</p>
