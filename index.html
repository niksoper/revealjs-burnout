            <p>Hello, my name is Nick.  I’ve been a professional geek for 13 years.</p>

            <p>I was lucky enough to be born and raised in Bristol - one of the UK’s great cities.
              I had a great childhood with brilliant parents.  I went to a really good school where I
              did well academically and had a decent group of friends - some of whom, I still count as my best friends today.</p>
      
            <p>I carried on doing well - academically and socially - at college and university, and in 2005 I started
              my career as a professional geek.</p>
      
            <p>Being a techie from Bristol, I didn’t have to look far for decent career opportunities.
              I’ve had four jobs in my career, and I’ve always moved to the next job as a positive,
              conscious choice - driven by a motivation to learn new skills and (more recently) to do some good in the world.</p>
      
            <p>I like to think I have a good work ethic, I always want to go a great job, and I always
              want to make professional progress.</p>
      
            <p>And in 2010, I even managed to trick someone into being my wife!</p>
      
            <p>WHAT A TOP BLOKE!</p>
