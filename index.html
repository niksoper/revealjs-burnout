            <p>My name's Nick, and I’ve been a professional geek for 13 years.</p>
            <p>I'm going to start by talking about myself a bit - most of you don't know me, after all.</p>

            <p>I was lucky enough to be born and raised in Bristol</p>

            <p>I had a great childhood with brilliant parents.</p>
            <p>(There I am stood in front of my mum.)</p>
            <p>I did well at school - I was never bullied - and always had a decent handful of friends - some of whom, I still
              count as my best friends today.</p>

            <p>I carried on doing well - academically and socially - at college and university, and in 2005 I started my career
              as a professional geek.</p>
            <p>Being a techie from Bristol, I didn’t have to look far for decent career opportunities.</p>
            <p>I’ve had four jobs in my career, and I’ve always moved to the next job as a positive, conscious choice.</p>
            <p>Driven by a motivation to learn new skills and (more recently) to do some good in the world.</p>
            <p>I like to think I have a good work ethic, I always want to go a great job, and I always want to make professional
              progress.

            <p>WHAT A TOP BLOKE!</p>
            <p>So - on 28th May 2018 - why was this top bloke struggling to hold back tears while helping choose some plants
              in a garden centre?</p>
            <p>CLUE: It was nothing to do with the flowers on offer.</p>

        <h2>I had burnt out</h2>
        <img src="images/burnt.jpg" />
        <aside class="notes">
          <p>I remember a conversation with a friend from 5 or 6 years ago when I said I didn’t understand why some people get
            so stressed about stuff.</p>
          <p>Just don’t worry about it!</p>
          <p>Although my tongue was in my cheek at the time, I still think I truly believed that stress was something that affected
            other people, but not me.</p>
          <p>I now realise not only that I am susceptible to stress, but it seems that those positive qualities of hard work,
            determination and drive have played a huge part in adding to the stress in my life.</p>
          <p>The unpleasant experience of holding back tears in a garden centre was the trigger that made me realise I needed
            to do something about my stress.</p>
          <p>There wasn’t one single event that lead to the garden centre experience.</p>
          <p>I had been aware of feeling stressed for at least six months and when I reflect on those months, I realise that
            it was inevitable that I would reach some sort of breaking point.</p>

          <h3>Talk about it</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>So what should we do? Talk. Listen. Encourage talking. Encourage listening. Keep adding to the conversation.</p>
            <cite>Matt Haig, Reasons to stay alive</cite>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>You remember I mentioned earlier that I’d once managed to trick someone into being my wife?</p>

            <p>Her name is Emma, and we’re still together and going strong - so naturally, the first conversation I had about
              my stress level was with her.</p>

            <p>This was a difficult thing to do. Hearing the words come out of my mouth made me upset. I found it hard to look
              at her while I was speaking. I didn’t know why it was so hard, but it was.</p>

            <p>The second person I spoke to about it was my boss. The conversation was equally as tough.</p>

            <p>I have a great relationship with Emma, and a great (but very different) relationship with my boss (both of them).
              This topic wasn’t difficult for me because I was worried what the other person would think - it was difficult
              for me because I wasn’t used to talking about what can be an awkward or even taboo issue: MENTAL HEALTH.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Mental health can be seen as a big, scary phrase. It can conjure thoughts of old-skool asylums like “One Flew
              Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” or Arkum, with straight jackets, padded cells and an environment more like a prison
              than a hospital.</p>
