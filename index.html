            <p>Hello, my name is Nick. I’ve been a professional geek for 13 years.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>I was lucky enough to be born and raised in Bristol - one of the UK’s great cities.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>I had a great childhood with brilliant parents. I went to a really good school where I did well academically
              and had a decent group of friends - some of whom, I still count as my best friends today.</p>

          <h3>Successful</h3>
          <img src="images/success.png" />
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>I carried on doing well - academically and socially - at college and university, and in 2005 I started my career
              as a professional geek.</p>

            <p>Being a techie from Bristol, I didn’t have to look far for decent career opportunities. I’ve had four jobs in
              my career, and I’ve always moved to the next job as a positive, conscious choice - driven by a motivation to
              learn new skills and (more recently) to do some good in the world.</p>

            <p>I like to think I have a good work ethic, I always want to go a great job, and I always want to make professional
              progress.

          <h3>Talk about it</h3>
          <blockquote>
            <p>So what should we do? Talk. Listen. Encourage talking. Encourage listening. Keep adding to the conversation.</p>
            <cite>Matt Haig, Reasons to stay alive</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <aside class="notes">
            <p>You remember I mentioned earlier that I’d once managed to trick someone into being my wife?</p>

            <p>Her name is Emma, and we’re still together and going strong - so naturally, the first conversation I had about
              my stress level was with her.</p>

            <p>This was a difficult thing to do. Hearing the words come out of my mouth made me upset. I found it hard to look
              at her while I was speaking. I didn’t know why it was so hard, but it was.</p>

            <p>The second person I spoke to about it was my boss. The conversation was equally as tough.</p>

            <p>I have a great relationship with Emma, and a great (but very different) relationship with my boss (both of them).
              This topic wasn’t difficult for me because I was worried what the other person would think - it was difficult
              for me because I wasn’t used to talking about what can be an awkward or even taboo issue: MENTAL HEALTH.</p>

          <aside class="notes">
            <p>Mental health can be seen as a big, scary phrase. It can conjure thoughts of old-skool asylums like “One Flew
              Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” or Arkum, with straight jackets, padded cells and an environment more like a prison
              than a hospital.</p>
